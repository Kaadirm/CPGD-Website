## Technology Used

- **TypeScript:** Enhances the React component's code integrity and developer experience by providing static typing for variables, props, and state.
- **React:** Utilized as a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, leveraging its component-based architecture, state management, and virtual DOM for efficient rendering.
- **SASS:** Organizes and enhances styling within the React component, leveraging SASS as a preprocessor scripting language for more maintainable and modular stylesheets.
- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets for styling the web application.
- **HTML:** The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **Axios:** : Functions as a promise-based HTTP client in the React component, facilitating asynchronous requests for fetching data from external APIs and submitting form data with handling of successful and error responses.
